Reddit-Scraper
==============

A web scraper designed to allow users to peruse subreddits of their choice. Users are given the option to input specific keywords or topics they would like to search for, the number of posts/pages they'd like to browse, and the minimum threshold score for the results. 

Successful results can then be written into a CSV file for ease of browsing.
